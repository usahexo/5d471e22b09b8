        <h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch’s-Ace-Could-be-Worth-5-Billion"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch’s-Ace-Could-be-Worth-5-Billion" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch’s Ace Could be Worth $5 Billion"></a>Rupert Murdoch’s Ace Could be Worth $5 Billion</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, the founder of News Corp and Fox News, just cashed out $2.6 billion worth of stock. He’s now sitting on a remaining $5 billion stake in the company.</p>
<p>At current prices, that would give Murdoch a paper net worth of $5 billion, but it’s really much higher when you include all the assets he controls.</p>
<p>Murdoch doesn’t need the money. He’s one of the richest people in the world with a net worth estimated at over $13 billion. So why did he sell?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons Murdoch may have decided to unload some of his stock. For one, Murdoch is 87 years old and may be looking to downsize his holdings. He might also be concerned about potential regulation from the Trump administration and want to reduce his exposure.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Murdoch’s remaining stake is now worth an estimated $5 billion. That makes him one of the biggest billionaires in the world and could make his ace worth even more down the road.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-is-Betting-Big-on-the-Ace"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-is-Betting-Big-on-the-Ace" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch is Betting Big on the Ace"></a>Rupert Murdoch is Betting Big on the Ace</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp is said to be in talks to invest as much as $1 billion in the Ace network, a startup that intends to build the world’s largest blockchain-based platform.</p>
<p>The investment would give News Corp a minority stake in the company and make it one of the largest investors in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>Murdoch has been bullish on the blockchain technology, calling it a “huge opportunity”.</p>
<p>“The sky’s the limit,” he said at an industry conference last year.</p>
<p>News Corp’s investment comes as other major companies are also making bets on the blockchain. IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon are just some of the big names that have been investing in blockchain startups and launching their own blockchains platforms.</p>
<p>What is Blockchain?</p>
<p>The blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. It was first developed as the underlying technology for Bitcoin, but has since been adopted by a variety of industries for its many potential uses.</p>
<p>How Does Blockchain Work?</p>
<p>Blockchain is built on a distributed ledger system where each participant in the network maintains a copy of the ledger. Transactions are verified by consensus among participants, then added to the ledger as a new block. This process creates a permanent and transparent record of all transactions on the network.</p>

<h1 id="Murdoch-Expects-to-Win-Big-with-Ace-in-Hand"><a href="#Murdoch-Expects-to-Win-Big-with-Ace-in-Hand" class="headerlink" title="Murdoch Expects to Win Big with Ace in Hand"></a>Murdoch Expects to Win Big with Ace in Hand</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch is no stranger to controversy. The media mogul has spent more than half a century in the public eye, weathering one storm after another. But even by Murdoch’s standards, the past year has been tumultuous.</p>
<p>First came the phone hacking scandal in the UK, which led to the closure of Murdoch’s News of the World tabloid and the arrest of several of his top executives. Then came revelations that News Corp had tried to illegally hack into the phones of 9&#x2F;11 victims – an act that many believe played a role in the company’s eventual sale of its US TV networks.</p>
<p>Amidst all this chaos, Murdoch is soldiering on. On Wednesday he announced plans to split News Corp in two, separating its troubled publishing division from its more lucrative TV and movie businesses. And on Thursday he made a move that could pay off big – he agreed to sell his $3 billion stake in British Sky Broadcasting, ending his long-standing feud with UK regulators.</p>
<p>Murdoch’s decision to dump BSkyB was seen as a sign of weakness by some observers, but I believe it was actually a shrewd move. By giving up his controlling interest in BSkyB, Murdoch has eliminated one of his biggest liabilities and strengthened his hand for future negotiations.</p>
<p>Now that Murdoch has shown that he’s willing to compromise, he can go into these talks with a much stronger position. He can afford to be more aggressive in seeking out new deals and concessions from UK regulators, knowing that he doesn’t need BSkyB quite as much as before.</p>
<p>The sale of BSkyB may also help appease US regulators, who have been scrutinizing News Corp’s operations since the phone hacking scandal broke last year. By dumping BSkyB and selling off some other non-core assets, Murdoch is signaling that he’s serious about cleaning up his act.</p>
<p>So far it looks like investors aren’t convinced – News Corp’s stock price has fallen sharply since Wednesday’s announcement. But I think this is just a temporary blip – over time investors will realize that Murdoch still has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. He may have taken a few hits recently, but at age 81 Rupert Murdoch is still one of the most formidable businessmen in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Ace-Could-be-Worth-Millions-for-Rupert-Murdoch"><a href="#Ace-Could-be-Worth-Millions-for-Rupert-Murdoch" class="headerlink" title="Ace Could be Worth Millions for Rupert Murdoch"></a>Ace Could be Worth Millions for Rupert Murdoch</h1><p>21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, is exploring a sale of its controlling stake in the live-streaming platform provider Ace Media, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The move comes as Fox refocuses its business on news and sports after Walt Disney agreed to buy most of its assets late last year.</p>
<p>Fox holds a 72% stake in Ace, which it co-founded with Michael Eisner’s investment firm, The Tornante Company, in 2014.</p>
<p>Ace provides technology and services to media companies including Fox News, ABC News and Univision Communications. It has more than 2,000 customers in more than 150 countries.</p>
<p>Disney is unlikely to be interested in acquiring Ace given its ownership of ESPN and other streaming platforms such as Hulu, which it plans to merge with newly acquired Twenty-First Century Fox assets. But other suitors could emerge for Ace, which is considered to be one of the largest providers of live-streaming services in the world.</p>

This is because the Ace can be used as either a 1-point or 11-point card, depending on the other cards in the hand. If the Ace is paired with another card, it becomes a 1-point card. If the Ace is paired with 2 or 3 other cards, it becomes an 11-point card.</p>
