#  Unicorn Gems is the new casino game that's taking the world by storm!

Created by mathematician and game designer, James Smith, Unicorn Gems is an online casino game that combines the excitement of slots with the strategy of poker.

The aim of the game is to accumulate as many gems as possible by matching symbols on the reels. Each gem is worth a different amount, with the purple gem being the most valuable.

Players can choose to bet on one, two, or all three of the reels. The more you bet, the higher your chances of winning – but also the higher your potential losses.

The key to winning at Unicorn Gems is knowing when to fold and when to keep betting. If you have a strong hand, then it might be worth risking your gems on another spin. But if you're holding weak cards, then it might be better to fold and wait for a better opportunity.

One thing's for sure: Unicorn Gems is a highly addictive game that's sure to keep you coming back for more!
