Bright lights, big action and delicious food are all a part of the Columbus casino experience. But on one special day each month, that action is all for the seniors. That's right - every casino in the city offers a buffet filled with discounted food for those 60 and older.

The promotion started a few years ago and has been growing in popularity ever since. Operators say it's a way to give back to the community and show their appreciation for customers who have been coming through their doors for decades.

"Our seniors are the lifeblood of our industry," said casino spokesperson Lydia Ortiz. "This is just a small way of thanking them for their business."

The buffets range in quality and price, but most offer a wide variety of dishes including carved meats, pasta dishes, seafood, salads and desserts. And because it's Columbus, there's usually something unique on the menu as well, like chicken and waffles or pig wings.

So if you're retired or close to retirement, be sure to check out the casino buffet in your area. It's a great way to spend a day out with friends or family and enjoy some delicious food at a fraction of the cost.
