#  Nevada Gambling Commission Issues New Guidelines for Licensing and Regulation 

The Nevada Gambling Commission has released a new set of guidelines for the licensing and regulation of gambling establishments in the state. The regulations are designed to bolster consumer protection and ensure that casinos and other gambling establishments operate in a responsible manner.

Among the new guidelines are regulations governing bonus offers, which must now be cleared by the commission in advance. This is aimed at preventing casinos from enticing players with excessive bonus offers that can lead to irresponsible gambling behavior.

Another new guideline prohibits casino operators from allowing customers to gamble beyond their means. This includes setting limits on how much money customers can spend and how much they can lose in a single day or sitting.

The commission has also strengthened its rules regarding self-exclusion programs. Customers who voluntarily enroll in such programs will now be banned from all forms of gambling, not just casino games. This is aimed at preventing problem gamblers from simply moving to other gambling platforms when they are banned from one casino.

Finally, the commission has clarified its rules regarding payout percentages. Casino operators must now ensure that their advertised payout percentages reflect the actual payout percentages achieved over a period of time, not just on individual games. This will give consumers a more accurate idea of the overall odds of winning at a particular casino.

#  Gaming Control Board Reminds Licensees of their Requirements 

The Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) has reminded all licensees of their statutory and regulatory requirements. In a statement, the agency said that it will take “appropriate enforcement action” against any licensee who fails to comply.

Among the key points highlighted by the NGCB were the following:

– Licensees must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML), gaming taxes, and responsible gaming.

– Licensees must ensure that their gaming operations are conducted in a safe and responsible manner, and that they take steps to prevent collusion, money laundering, and other criminal activity.

– Licensees must pay all applicable gaming taxes on time and in full. Failing to do so may result in revocation of the license or other enforcement actions.

– Licensees must submit accurate financial reports to the NGCB on a regular basis. Any misrepresentations or omissions may lead to disciplinary action.

In light of these reminders, it is important for all casino operators in Nevada to ensure that they are in compliance with state law. Licenses can be revoked for noncompliance, so it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest regulations.

#  Delaware Issues Guidance on Physical Presence for Gambling Operators 

The Delaware Gaming Control Board (DGCE) issued a statement on October 2, 2018, outlining the physical presence requirements for gambling operators in the state. The requirements are based on the findings of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which struck down the federal prohibition on sports betting.

In its statement, the DGCE said that a gambling operator must have a “substantial and continuing presence” in Delaware in order to offer gambling services in the state. The presence must be more than just a physical office or headquarters; it must involve actual operations in Delaware.

The DGCE laid out four factors that will be used to determine whether an operator has a substantial and continuing presence in Delaware:

1. The percentage of revenue generated by the operator from customers located in Delaware;
2. The number of employees of the operator who are residents of Delaware;
3. The amount of money wagered or lost by customers located in Delaware; and
4. The extent to which the gambling activities offered by the operator are available to customers located in Delaware.

The DGCE noted that these factors are not exhaustive, and that other considerations may be taken into account when determining an operator’s presence in Delaware.

#  Maryland Announces Changes to its Gambling Regulations 

The state of Maryland has announced a series of changes to its gambling regulations, most notably the legalization of online gambling. The new rules will go into effect on October 1, and will allow residents of the state to gamble online. 

Maryland is not the only state to legalize online gambling in recent months; both Pennsylvania and New Jersey have also taken similar steps. The move is seen as a way to bring in additional revenue for the states, as well as to provide more options for gamblers. 

Online gambling will be regulated by the Maryland Gaming Commission, which will set standards for operators and ensure that players are protected. Players will be able to deposit money into their accounts and gamble on games such as poker, blackjack, slots, and roulette. There will be a minimum age requirement of 21 years old in order to participate in online gambling. 

Not everyone is happy with the new regulations. Some opponents argue that the legalization of online gambling could lead to addiction and other problems. Others worry that it could be used by criminals to launder money or cheat players. However, proponents argue that the benefits outweigh the risks, and that proper regulation can mitigate any potential negative impacts. 

With online gambling now legal in three states, it is likely that more will follow suit in the coming years. This is a developing area of law, and there are still many questions about how it will be implemented and what effects it will have. For now, Maryland residents can prepare for October 1 – when they will be able to gamble online for the first time ever within their state’s borders.

#  Pennsylvania Updates Application Process for Casino Licenses

The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) has announced updates to the application process for casino licenses. The new process is designed to speed up the approval process and ensure that only qualified applicants are granted licenses.

The PGCB will now require a letter of intent from all applicants, as well as an overview of the proposed gaming and entertainment complex. The letter of intent must include a detailed timeline for the project, as well as a description of the applicant’s qualifications.

The PGCB will also require an in-depth financial review of all applicants. This review will include an examination of the company’s assets and liabilities, as well as its ability to finance the project.

In order to ensure that only qualified applicants are approved, the PGCB will also conduct a background check on all principals and key employees of the applicant company. This check will include a review of criminal records and financial statements.

The new application process went into effect on January 1, 2019.
